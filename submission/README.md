# Submission for the Deep Learning Challenge

This archive contains the final submission for the Deep Learning Challenge of this course. I have included **only the necessary weights** for the final models. Additional weights and resources can be found in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fabibec/DL-Challenge/).

Additionally, I moved the dataset into the `dataset` folder as seen in the repository. You need to do the same to rerun any of the notebooks if desired.

## Closing Note
I would like to thank you for this very interesting and well-structured course. It provided a solid overview of the deep learning landscape. Broad enough to give context and direction, yet focused enough to enable deeper exploration through the additional material provided.

Best regards,

*Fabian Becker*
