# DL-Challenge

This is the final project of a course on Deep Learning taught by Prof. Vincet Barra. During lecture we got introduced to a variety of different Deep Learning model.

The objective of this challenge is to apply our knowledge to a given problem. We were asked to find both a good classifier and generative model.

## Dataset

The supplied dataset contains grayscale images of size 28x28 and images stem from the Google Quickdraw Dataset. 5 classes were provided baskets, eyes, binoculars, rabbits and hands with 15000 training examples and 5000 test examples.

## Classifier model

For the classifier I constructed a CNN, which I also evaluated against some pretrained models by doing transfer learning.

## Generative model

For the generative model i build different variations of Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.
